# Skeleton — researcher template

The **Skeleton** is Eye_lean's clean trial-loop scaffold for building your own
VR experiment. It's a **developer-side tool**: the MainMenu doesn't launch
into it and the wizard does NOT add the generated scene to Build Settings. You
use it in the editor as a starting point, add it to your own build settings
when you're ready to ship, and Eye_lean's recording / replay / RIPA layer
comes along for the ride.

[SampleExperiment](SAMPLE_EXPERIMENT.md) (build-2 in the shipped APK) remains
the worked example you can read end-to-end. The Skeleton is the *minimum
viable scaffold* for when you'd rather start from a blank canvas.

The Skeleton's value is **shape**: a trial state machine
(ITI → Platform → Fixation → ExperimentalPhase → TrialComplete) plus an
`IExperimentPhaseHandler` interface where your code lives. Implement four
methods, you're done.

Use it when your task fits a "trials-with-phases" loop and you want a fresh
scene with minimum scaffolding and full Eye_lean recording / replay / RIPA out
of the box.

## How to use it

1. Open Eye_lean in Unity.
2. Run **VR Experiment > New Skeleton Scene** from the Unity menu.
   - Creates `Assets/Scenes/Skeleton.unity` and populates it with
     Managers + Eye_lean recorder rig + a demo phase handler.
   - Does **not** add the scene to EditorBuildSettings — Skeleton
     is a developer tool, not a shipped APK target. Add it to your
     build manually when you're ready to deploy your experiment.
3. Implement `IExperimentPhaseHandler` in a new MonoBehaviour
   (start by copying
   `Assets/Scripts/Skeleton/Examples/EyeleanDemoPhaseHandler.cs`).
4. Press Play in the editor.

### Verify

Console shows `[RIPAMonitor] Active`, `[SessionRecorder] CSV
initialized`, and `[TrialManager] Initialized N trials`. The CSV
writes with phase / trial / metadata columns. The events sidecar
logs `TrialStarted`, `TrialPhaseChanged`, and `TrialCompleted` rows.

## Eye_lean integration table

This is the full wiring map between Skeleton's events and Eye_lean's
recording surfaces. It happens automatically — no researcher
action required. Knowing it helps when reading the recorded CSVs.

| Skeleton trigger | Eye_lean recorder call | CSV / sidecar effect |
|---|---|---|
| `TrialManager.Start` | `RecordJson("ConfigTrials", ...)` + `RecordKV("RandomSeed", ...)` | Events sidecar gets the trial-config snapshot + the seed for `Random.InitState`. |
| `OnPhaseChanged(phase)` | `SessionRecorder.SetSubTask(phase)` + `RecordKV("TrialPhaseChanged", ...)` | Per-frame `SubTask` column tracks the live phase; events sidecar logs the boundary. |
| `OnTrialStarted(trial)` (FixationCross entry) | `SessionRecorder.SetSessionContext(trial, ...)` + `SetMetadata("TrialBlockName", ...)` + `RecordKV("TrialStarted", ...)` | `TrialNumber` / `CurrentPhase` / `SessionConfig` columns track the live trial. |
| `OnTrialCompleted(trial)` | `SetMetadata` for every key in `GetPhaseData()` + `RecordKV("TrialCompleted", ...)` | Per-frame metadata columns get the trial's per-trial data; events sidecar logs the boundary + summary. |
| `OnAllTrialsCompleted` | `Record("AllTrialsCompleted")` | Events sidecar logs end-of-session. |
| `AgentManager.SpawnAgent` | `SceneStateRecorder.MarkRecordableSeeded(go, "Agent_{trial}_{slot}")` + `RecordKV("AgentSpawn", ...)` | Scene-state sidecar records the spawn at a deterministic GUID; replay reproduces. |
| `EyeleanDemoPhaseHandler.OnPhaseStart` | `RecordKV("StimulusOnset", ...)` + `MarkRecordableSeeded("DemoStimulus_{trial}")` | Per-trial event + scene-state row. |
| `EyeleanDemoPhaseHandler.GetPhaseData` | `SetMetadata` for every returned key | Per-trial metadata columns: `responseReceived`, `responseTime`, `phaseDuration`, `ripaAtResponse`. |

## Common patterns + gotchas

- **The wizard overwrites if you re-run it.** Back up authored scene
  content first.
- **No need to add `RIPAMonitor` to the scene yourself.** The
  bootstrap (`RIPAMonitorBootstrap`) auto-spawns it. If you want to
  opt out, set `RIPAMonitorBootstrap.DisableAutoSpawn = true` before
  scene load.
- **`Random.InitState` is seeded by `TrialManager`.** Don't
  re-seed elsewhere or replay will diverge.
- **Per-trial spawns must use `MarkRecordableSeeded`.** Editor-
  authored objects are auto-tagged via their inspector-assigned
  `Recordable`. Runtime spawns are NOT auto-tagged; if you want them
  reproduced on replay, you must call `MarkRecordableSeeded` with a
  per-trial-stable seed.
